[git reset --hard] only deletes a file if you've run [git add] on the new file
[git reset --hard] undoes any changes that have happened to files that have been added to the
	repository
Creating a new file while in a branch and running [git add] on it will make the file available
	to any of the existing branches
	For example, rabbit_squared.txt appeared in the directory no matter which branch was checked
	out and running [git add] on the file while the <magic_squared> branch was checked out still
	appared as added when a different branch was checked out
After committing <magic_squared.txt>, the file no longer appeared when I listed the files in
	the directory while the <master> branch was checked out
The above two changes in <notes.txt> were no longer in the file after committing to the <master>
	branch
When checking out a branch, all files that were added to the previous branch seem to be added
	to the currently checked out branch. After commit, behaves as though you had both added and
	committed in the current branch
[git merge <target>] adds files from <target> into the currently checked out branch
